## Feature vs Guild Work

* Have an engineer as a project/tech lead, who represents engs and shares progress/work to stakeholders
* Improve process of negotiating feature vs guild work
* Reduce personal struggle with justifying non-feature work during sprints
* Have guild (x-team) discussions for feature work to plan ahead
* Elevate guilds to have more authority/weight when it comes to decisions/planning
* Normalize Eng. workflow to include guild work as part of weekly work
* Understand that feedback/ideas come from agreed upon guild discussions rather than individuals
